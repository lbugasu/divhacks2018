# divhacks2018
This is the Project I worked on For DivHacks 2018 

The program analyzes test and training data results from MNIST data applied against 21 Algorithms that try to identify each MNIST digit

The program will ask you to enter a threshold value(in percentage) to classify whether a digit is easy or hard. 

In order to try a range of threshold values, the program will ask you whether you would like to try different threshold values for the test data

Once you have tuned your threshold value, you can select the option to analyze the training dataset using your selected threshold

The program will output all your results from trials of different threshold values and the final resulta from the training data to a text file called "results.txt"
